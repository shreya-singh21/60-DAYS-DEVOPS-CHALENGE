## :cloud: What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than using a local server or personal computer. It provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, including storage, servers, databases, software applications, and more.

### :bulb: Advantages and Scope

- **Scalability:** Cloud computing allows for easy scalability, enabling businesses to quickly expand or reduce their computing resources based on demand.
- **Cost Savings:** By utilizing cloud services, businesses can avoid the upfront costs of infrastructure setup and maintenance, and instead pay for what they use on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.
- **Flexibility and Mobility:** Cloud computing enables users to access their data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, providing flexibility and mobility for businesses and individuals.
- **Reliability and Redundancy:** Cloud providers often offer robust infrastructure and backup systems, ensuring high availability and data redundancy.
- **Collaboration and Remote Work:** Cloud computing facilitates collaboration among teams by allowing them to access and work on shared resources and documents from different locations.

- :white_check_mark: [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- :white_check_mark: [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)
- :white_check_mark: [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud)
- :white_check_mark: [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/)

## :sparkles: Features of Cloud Computing

- **Elasticity:** Cloud services can easily scale up or down based on demand, allowing businesses to optimize resource allocation and cost-efficiency.
- **Pay-as-you-go:** Cloud providers typically offer a flexible pricing model where users only pay for the resources they use, avoiding upfront infrastructure costs.
- **On-demand self-service:** Users can provision resources and services on-demand without requiring manual intervention from the cloud provider.
- **Resource pooling:** Cloud computing resources are shared among multiple users, enabling efficient utilization and cost sharing.
- **Broad network access:** Cloud services can be accessed via the internet using a variety of devices and platforms.
- **Security:** Cloud providers often offer robust security measures and compliance standards to protect data and ensure privacy.

## :computer: Types of Cloud Computing

There are three primary types of cloud computing models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networks, allowing users to build and manage their own infrastructure within the cloud environment.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. It provides a framework and runtime environment for developers.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access and use the applications without having to worry about installation, maintenance, or infrastructure management.

## :white_check_mark: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud platform providers. It offers a wide range of cloud services and solutions, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, and more.

## :rocket:Lets Start our DEVOPS journey with AWS and EC2

### :loudspeaker: Now We Have a Fair Idea About Cloud Computing

Now that we have a fair idea about cloud computing, let's start our DevOps journey with Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is one of the leading cloud platform providers that offers a wide range of services for building and deploying applications in the cloud.

### :computer: EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

One of the fundamental services provided by AWS is EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). EC2 allows you to create and manage virtual servers, known as instances, in the AWS cloud. These instances provide scalable compute capacity and can be easily configured to meet your specific requirements.

When working with EC2, it's essential to understand the following key concepts:

- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** An AMI is a pre-configured template that contains the necessary software to launch an instance. It serves as the foundation for your instances and includes the operating system and any additional software you may need.
- **Instance Types:** AWS offers a variety of instance types with different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. You can choose the instance type that best suits your application's requirements.
- **Security Groups:** Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for your instances. You can define rules to allow or restrict specific types of traffic to and from your instances.
- **Key Pairs:** Key pairs are used for secure login to your instances. You can create a key pair and then associate it with your instance during launch. This enables secure SSH access to your instance.

If you're new to AWS and want to learn how to create an EC2 instance and get started with AWS services, you can follow step-by-step tutorials and guides available in the AWS documentation and various online resources.
