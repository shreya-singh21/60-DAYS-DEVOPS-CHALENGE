We will then explore different types of Linux commands. Linux commands are categorized based on their functionality and purpose. Understanding these command types will help you navigate and utilize Linux effectively.

The types of Linux commands we will cover include:

- System Commands
- File Management Commands
- Process Management Commands
- Networking Commands
- Package Management Commands
- Text Processing Commands
- User Management Commands

* File and Folder Transfer between Local Machine and EC2 using SCP 
Make sure to explore each command type and learn how they can be used in different scenarios.

As you progress through Day 2, remember to apply your knowledge from Day 1, as Linux commands and understanding Linux will be essential in infrastructure automation and DevOps practices.

## Day 3: EC2 Instances, Elastic IP, Web Servers, and Bootstrap for EC2

On Day 3 of our DevOps learning journey, we will focus on EC2 instances and explore the concept of Elastic IP, the significance of webservers, and leveraging Bootstrap for EC2.

**AWS Elastic IP**: A static public IP address provided by AWS, offering persistence and accessibility advantages.

**Creating an Elastic IP**: Step-by-step process to create an Elastic IP address in the AWS EC2 Management Console and associate it with your desired EC2 instance.

**Associating and Disassociating Elastic IP**: Learn how to associate and disassociate an Elastic IP with an EC2 instance, controlling IP address mapping.

**Releasing Elastic IP**: Understand the steps to release an Elastic IP address and avoid unnecessary charges.

**Web Servers**: Exploring their role in serving web content, converting an EC2 instance into a web server.

**Creating a Web Server Using Bootstrap Script**: Discovering the concept of Bootstrap script and how it automates web server setup.

Feel free to explore the Day 3 folder to dive deeper into these topics and access additional resources related to AWS ip addresses.


## Day 4: Placement Groups, Load Balancers, Target Groups, and Launch Templates
On Day 4 of our DevOps learning journey, we will delve into important topics such as Placement Groups, Load Balancers, Target Groups, and Launch Templates. These concepts play a crucial role in optimizing infrastructure, enhancing scalability, and improving the overall performance of our applications.

Make sure to check the Day 4 folder for detailed learnings and resources related to these topics.


## Day 5: AWS EC2 Auto Scaling, AWS Status Check, Automatic Recovery

On Day 5 of our DevOps learning journey, we focused on the following topics:

- AWS EC2 Auto Scaling: We learned how to create an Auto Scaling group with a load balancer in AWS EC2. This involves creating a launch configuration or launch template, setting up a topic in AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), creating the Auto Scaling group, configuring an Application Load Balancer (ALB), creating a target group, setting up an alarm in CloudWatch, and adding a scaling policy to the Auto Scaling group.

- AWS Status Check: We explored the AWS Status Check feature, which ensures the health and availability of EC2 instances. We learned about system status checks and instance status checks, and how they help monitor the overall system and instance health.

- Automatic Recovery: We discussed automatic recovery in AWS, which is enabled when a system status check failure occurs. We explored how to enable auto recovery for an instance and how AWS automatically attempts to recover the instance in case of a failure.

By understanding these concepts and practices, we gained valuable insights into scaling our EC2 instances, monitoring their health, and ensuring automatic recovery in case of failures.

## Day 6: Snapshots, Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Scheduled Snapshots, Data Lifecycle Manager, and the Recycle Bin

On Day 6 of our DevOps learning journey, we will continue exploring AWS storage services. We will focus on important topics such as Snapshots, Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Scheduled Snapshots, Data Lifecycle Manager, and the Recycle Bin. These storage features will enhance our data protection, backup management, automation capabilities, and overall efficiency in managing our AWS infrastructure.

In the Day 6 folder, you will discover:

- Snapshots: Learn how to create point-in-time copies of your block storage data, such as EBS volumes, to protect against accidental deletion and enable data recovery.

- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs): Explore pre-configured templates that contain the necessary software and configurations to launch instances in Amazon EC2. Learn how to create custom AMIs and utilize them for consistent instance deployments.

- Scheduled Snapshots: Discover how to automate the creation of EBS snapshots based on defined schedules using AWS Event Bridge. This ensures regular and consistent backups of your EC2 instance's volumes.

- Data Lifecycle Manager: Simplify the process of managing your data backups with Data Lifecycle Manager. Learn how to automatically create, retain, and delete EBS snapshots based on predefined policies.

- The Recycle Bin: Utilize the Recycle Bin feature in AWS to store and manage deleted EBS snapshots, providing a safety net against accidental data loss and allowing for easy recovery if needed.

Feel free to explore the Day 6 folder to dive deeper into these topics and access additional resources related to AWS storage services.

## Day 7: Simple Storage Service (S3)

Building upon our previous knowledge gained during the first six days of our 60 Days DevOps Challenge, we're diving into the powerful world of Simple Storage Service (S3). Day 7 focuses on understanding S3's unique features, bucket management, pricing, versioning advantages, and recovery. We'll explore static website hosting, various storage classes, replication options, access control, and Life Cycle Management. Additionally, we'll delve into Event Notification with SNS and SQS Services. Let's expand our expertise in S3 and continue mastering AWS services in DevOps!
