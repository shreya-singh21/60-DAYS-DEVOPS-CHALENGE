# DevOps 60-Day Challenge

Welcome to the DevOps 60-Day Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you learn and explore various aspects of DevOps, including cloud computing, infrastructure automation, continuous integration and deployment, and more. Each day, you will focus on a specific topic and document your learnings in a corresponding folder.

## Roadmap

Here is an overview of the 60-day roadmap:

1. [Day 1: Cloud Computing](https://github.com/shreya-singh21/60-DAYS-DEVOPS-CHALENGE/tree/master/DAY_1)
2. [Day 2: Linux Commands and File and Folder Transfer between Local Machine and EC2 using SCP](https://github.com/shreya-singh21/60-DAYS-DEVOPS-CHALENGE/tree/master/DAY_2)


## Day 1: Cloud Computing

In the [Day 1 folder](https://github.com/shreya-singh21/60-DAYS-DEVOPS-CHALENGE/tree/master/DAY_1), you will find the learnings related to cloud computing. Cloud computing is a fundamental concept in DevOps, and it involves leveraging remote servers and services for storing, managing, and processing data.

In the Day 1 folder, you will discover:

- An explanation of what cloud computing is
- Advantages and scope of cloud computing
- Top cloud platform companies
- Features of cloud computing
- Types of cloud computing

Feel free to explore the Day 1 folder to dive deeper into the topic and access additional resources.

## Day 2: Linux Commands and File and Folder Transfer between Local Machine and EC2 using SCP

## Introduction to Linux

In Day 2, we will start by exploring the basics of Linux. Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in the DevOps world. Understanding Linux and its commands is essential for DevOps.

Topics covered in the Introduction to Linux section include:

- Where to run Linux commands
- Examples of popular Linux operating systems

## Importance of Learning Linux and Linux Commands for DevOps Practitioners

Next, we will discuss the significance of learning Linux and Linux commands for DevOps practitioners. As a DevOps professional, having a solid understanding of Linux will empower you to effectively work with various tools and technologies used in the DevOps ecosystem.

## Types of Linux Commands

We will then explore different types of Linux commands. Linux commands are categorized based on their functionality and purpose. Understanding these command types will help you navigate and utilize Linux effectively.

The types of Linux commands we will cover include:

- System Commands
- File Management Commands
- Process Management Commands
- Networking Commands
- Package Management Commands
- Text Processing Commands
- User Management Commands

# File and Folder Transfer between Local Machine and EC2 using SCP
Make sure to explore each command type and learn how they can be used in different scenarios.

As you progress through Day 2, remember to apply your knowledge from Day 1, as Linux commands and understanding Linux will be essential in infrastructure automation and DevOps practices.


As you progress through the challenge, make sure to check the corresponding folders for each day to access the specific learnings and resources related to that topic.

Happy learning and enjoy your DevOps journey!
